Basically, RAPTOR is a flowchart logic building algorithm visualizer etc etc (you make neat little flowcharts in it.)
We learned to use RAPTOR in the spring of 2022 during my junior high school year. It was useless, pretty much.

* First of all DOWNLOADING Raptor seems to be a requirement.
* It does involve some special syntax you'd have to learn before starting on flowcharts.
* You are free to copy and paste all the programs I have provided.
